## Usage Instructions

The easiest way to compile the pdf is to use the provided scripts.

### Command line (with make)

In a terminal (i.e., on the command line), navigate to the project directory and run:
> make
(courtesy of @ilfreddy)

### Powershell (Windows)

In the powershell, navigate to the current project directory, and run:
> .\build.ps1

Both the above scripts will produce [document1.pdf](document1.pdf) and [document2.pdf](document2.pdf),
corresponding to the two parts of Part B in the 2018 call. 
It will also produce [IF-2018-Part_B.pdf](IF-2018-Part_B.pdf), which contains both parts.
When submitting the grant, one must submit documents 1 and 2 separately.

To prepare your proposal you will want to:

  1. Edit the relevant metadata in [IF-2018-Part_B.tex](IF-2018-Part_B.tex), 
  such as your proposal acronym.

  2. Complete [doc1.tex](doc1.tex), which corresponds to the first document of Part B 
  in the 2018 call.

  3. Complete [doc2.tex](doc2.tex), which corresponds to the second document.


If you encounter difficulties compiling the pdf, try the following:

 * Delete all `*.aux` files before compiling.

 * Consult [this StackOverflow answer](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/31366/84485),
 which is what the script is based on.

 * Just build [IF-2018-Part_B.tex](IF-2018-Part_B.tex) normally and then manually split the files.
