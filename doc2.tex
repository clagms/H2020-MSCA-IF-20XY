\section{Capacity of the Participating Organisations}
\label{sec:capacity}

\ul{List of participating organisations (one page)}

\medskip\noindent
Please provide a list of all participating organisations (the beneficiary and, where

\section{Ethical Issues}
\label{sec:ethics}

Compliance with the relevant ethics provisions is essential from the beginning to the end of
the action and is an integral part of research funded by the European Union within Horizon 2020. 

\medskip\noindent
Applicants submitting research proposals for funding with Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie actions in
Horizon 2020 should demonstrate proactively that they are aware of, and will comply with, European
and national legislation and fundamental ethical principles, including those reflected in the 
\href{http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf}{Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}
and the \href{http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf}{European Convention on Human Rights and its Supplementary Protocols}.

\medskip\noindent
Please be aware that it is the applicants' responsibility to identify any potential ethical issue, 
to handle the ethical aspects of the proposal and to detail how these aspects will be addressed.

\bigskip\noindent
{\large {\bf \ul{The Ethics Review Procedure in Horizon 2020}}}

\medskip\noindent
All proposals above threshold and considered for funding will be subject to an Ethics Review carried out by independent ethics experts. 
When submitting a proposal to Horizon 2020, all applicants are required to complete an Ethics Issues Table (EIT) in the Part A of the proposal. 
Applicants who flag ethical issues in the EIT have to also complete a more in-depth Ethics Self-Assessment in Part B.

\medskip\noindent
The ethics self-assessment will become part of the Grant Agreement and may thus lead to
binding obligations. The Grant Agreement can only be signed if all ethics requirement
have been duly addressed. The ethics review result will distinguish between ethics
requirements to be addressed before Grant Agreement signature and those that can be
cleared at a later stage (e.g. ethics approvals to be submitted before the start of the action
task). In the latter case, a separate work package 'Ethics Requirements' listing the
deliverables will be created automatically.

\medskip\noindent
\setlength{\fboxsep}{1mm}
\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
For more details, please refer to the H2020
\href{http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/ethics/h2020_hi_ethics-self-assess_en.pdf}{``How to complete your Ethics Self-Assessment''} guide.
}}

\bigskip\noindent
{\large {\bf \ul{Ethics Self-Assessment (Part B)}}}

\medskip\noindent
The Ethics Self-Assessment must:

{\bf
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, label=\arabic*)]
  \item Describe how the proposal meets the EU and national legal and ethics requirements of the country/countries where the task raising ethical is to be carried out.
\end{enumerate}
}

\medskip\noindent
For more information on how to deal with Third Countries\footnote{In the context of ethics
appraisal, Third Country refers to non-EU country; Associated Countries are "ethics"
TC} please see Article 34 of the
\href{http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/amga/h2020-amga_en.pdf}{Annotated Model Grant Agreement},
as well as the
\href{http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm}{rules for the protection of personal data inside and outside the EU}.
Please ensure and confirm that the research performed outside the EU
is compatible with the Union, National and International legislation and could have
been legally conducted in one of the EU Member States.

\medskip\noindent
Please list the documents provided with their expiry date.

\medskip\noindent
Ensure early compliance of the proposed research with EU and national legislation on
ethics in research. Should your proposal be selected for funding, you will be required - if
applicable - to confirm that you have obtained the following documents needed for
implementing the action tasks in question:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item any ethics committee opinion required under national law and
  \item any notification or authorisation for activities raising ethical issues required under national and/or European law
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\noindent
under national and/or European law
If you have not already applied for/received the ethics approval/required ethics
documents when submitting the proposal, please indicate in this section the approximate
date when you will obtain the relevant approvals/authorisations and any other ethics
documents. Please state explicitly that you will not proceed with any research with ethical
implications before obtaining the necessary authorizations/opinions.

\medskip\noindent
\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}
{\em The documents must be kept on file and be submitted upon request by the beneficiary to
the REA (see Article 52). If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with
an English summary, which shows that the action tasks in question are covered and
includes the conclusions of the committee or authority concerned (if available).

\medskip\noindent
If you plan to request these ethics documents specifically for your proposed action, your
request must contain an explicit reference to the action's title.
}}

\bigskip
{\bf 
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*, label=\arabic*), start=2]
  \item Explain in detail how you intend to address the ethical issues flagged, in particular with regard to: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\normalfont the research {\bf objectives} (e.g., study of vulnerable 
    populations, cooperation with a Third Country, etc.);}
    \item {\normalfont the research {\bf methodology} (e.g., clinical trials, 
    involvement of children and related information and consent/assent procedures, data protection and privacy issues related to data collected, etc.);}
    \item {\normalfont the potential {\bf impact} of the research (e.g. dual use issues,
    environmental damage, malevolent use, etc.);}
    \item {\normalfont appropriate health and safety procedures - conforming to relevant
    local/national guidelines/legislation - for the staff involved;}
    \item {\normalfont  possible harm to the environment the research might cause
    (e.g. environmental risks of nanomaterials), and measures that will be taken to mitigate the risks.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
}

\noindent
In order to facilitate the ethics review of the proposal, you may wish to include in this section
one of the following statements (if relevant/applicable). Please delete as appropriate:

\section{Letter of Commitment (GF only)}
\label{sec:letters}

For Global Fellowship proposals, a {\em letter of commitment} \textbf{of the partner
organisations} (hosting the outgoing phase in a Third country) must be included in Part
B-2 to ensure their real and active participation. 
Do not attach this letter as a separate PDF file or as an
embedded file since this makes them invisible in the proposal. GF Proposals which fail to
include a letter of commitment of the partner organisation will be declared \textbf{inadmissible}.

\medskip\noindent
Minimum requirements for the letter of commitment:

\begin{itemize}
  \item heading or stamp from the institution;
  \item up-to-date (may not be dated prior to the call publication);
  \item the text must demonstrate the will to actively participate in the (identified) proposed action and the precise role.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Please note that no template for this letter is provided, only general indications.
